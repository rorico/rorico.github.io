			This is a google extension I created in order to help with my time management.<br>
			I keep track of my internet usage in the last 30 minutes, and if too much time is spend on webpages that I find distracting such as reddit and youtube, I block them.<br>
			This is done using the google APIs to inject content scripts into the webpage, which overlays the page with something more productive. At the moment, it shows a timeline of the last 30 minutes, as well as my todo list and productivity bar.<br>
			This extension is also integrated with my class schedule, ensuring that I am always on track in class, as well as showing my schedule any time I need it.<br>
			There are ways to interact with the extension via Chrome's browserAction. A lot of commands that can be used to override the default behaviour.<br>
			Largely written in JavaScript.

			Can be played <a href="http://game.rorico.ca">here</a> as a multiplayer game.
			My family plays a board game called "Double Series". After losing a couple game, my dad started complaining about how the game was all luck and said was probably no skill needed to win. In retaliation I created a game simulation with different AIs to show that different strategies can win more than others. Just kidding, I was also curious myself. Turns out there is skill involved.<br>
			This started a project that has since become a great learning tool for various web development features. I added more AIs, hosted it on a server, turned the game multiplayer, and faced my brother in an AI battle.<br>
			Built using Node.js<br>
